scRNA pipeline draft

1) load data 
	can be raw data or filtered data (from CellRanger, etc.)
	also need to load cell cycle genes (depends on species)
	merge data
		can do this later if have a lot of datasets
2) QC
	a) UMI
	b) genes
		can ignore if want max genes for analysis but it can potential affect downstream analysis 
	c) mitochondrial genes
	d)* ambient gene expression
		SoupX or ignore strong ambient genes?
3) Processing
